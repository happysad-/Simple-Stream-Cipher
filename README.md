# Simple-Stream-Cipher (SSC)
This is a version of a stream cipher that is meant to be simple and fast. This is the start of the project which means
that the encryption is very weak, algorithm is slow and a lot of play is going to get done to optimize and improve
everything.

I am not responsible for any use of the code inorder to protect documents, files, sensitive data, etc.
